Here are some models/functions written during computational psychology class for modeling experimental paradigms to establish quantitative, objective measurements of underlying cognitive processes. 

### The final project is my own computational modeling that on the following:

Motivation:
Education has always been a heated topic. All parents want their children to do better; however they provide “support” in different ways. Today’s child psychology has categorized parenting styles into four categories: permissive, authoritative, neglectful and authoritarian. Specifically, most parents in the United States are either authoritative or authoritarian. Not to assess which parenting style is definitely better than the other, this stimulation’s purpose is to see how students’ study behavior, specifically study time, would be impacted by their parenting styles given the grades received and provides some insights into what could be observed in real-world experiments.

Introduction:
In this experiment, we aim to explore the intricate relationship between parenting styles and the academic behaviors of high school students, particularly focusing on how these styles influence students’ adjustment of study time for assignments. The core of our research questions revolves around two key aspects: Firstly, the impact of parenting style on the adjustments students make to their study time prior to assignments, and secondly, how this impact, in conjunction with the time adjustment, affects students’ aspirational grades for subsequent assignments. My hypothesis is that since students with authoritarian parents are taught to obey their parents’ rules, they are less likely to have independent thinking on how much they should study, thus adjusting their study time less than the authoritative students. In this experiment design, we will stimulate a high school course with 3 assignments: first assignment weighing 20% of the overall grade, the midterm weighing 30%, and the final weighing 50%.
